 With the love for repurposing furniture, I adore thrifting for damaged or excellent-conditioned pieces. Like, dressers, desks, coffee tables, etc. The older the furniture, the better, and creating it into something unique and 
useful. This display of dressers will provide you with visions of how to repurpose furniture that some might deem as junk. You will furthermore see how to deliver that old dresser a fresh update with paint, stain, distressing and more.</p></div>

It was such a journey because since I was self-taught, there was such a process where I utilized that time so much that it made me so disciplined. Playing the guitar gives me such joy. It truly inspires me to teach kids who want to understand or need an escape.  </p></div>

This hobby has become a business.   </p></div>

The textures and hues that it brings just come together. Designing things can be deemed a stress reliever. It is shared ideas and inspiration and encourages others to show off their design skills. The best aspect of it all is going shopping and searching for the right piece and uniqueness.  </p></div>
